# Tanzania_Region_District_Population
The **Tanzania\_Region_District** shapefile represents administrative district boundaries across four census years—**1988, 2002, 2012, and 2022**—highlighting changes in administrative divisions and enabling temporal analysis of demographic and territorial shifts in Tanzania. This dataset is particularly useful for comparing how district and region boundaries have evolved over time, supporting studies in population growth, regional planning, and governance restructuring. Each feature includes attributes for district and region names and corresponding census data, making it suitable for longitudinal spatial analysis. **Data source: [City Population – Tanzania Administrative Division](https://www.citypopulation.de/en/tanzania/admin/)**.
